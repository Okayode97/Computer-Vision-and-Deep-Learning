If you don’t take risks, you can’t create a future! If you don’t like your destiny, don’t accept it. When you give up, that’s when the game ends. All we can do is live until the day we die. Control what we can…and fly free. Forgetting is like a wound. The wound may heal, but it has already left a scar. It’s just pathetic to give up on something before you even give it a shot.” If you don’t share someone’s pain, you can never understand them. Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back. We don’t have to know what tomorrow holds! That’s why we can live for everything we’re worth today!” Why should I apologize for being a monster? Has anyone ever apologized for turning me into one? People become stronger because they have memories they can’t forget. I’ll leave tomorrow’s problems to tomorrow’s me. If you wanna make people dream, you’ve gotta start by believing in that dream yourself! Being lonely is more painful then getting hurt. There’s no shame in falling down! True shame is to not stand up again! Simplicity is the easiest path to true beauty. If you can’t do something, then don’t. Focus on what you can. Giving up kills people. When people reject giving up… they finally win the right to transcend humanity. You can die anytime, but living takes true courage.” Every journey begins with a single step. We just have to have patience. It doesn’t do any good to pretend you can’t see what’s going on. Being weak is nothing to be ashamed of… Staying weak is !! To act is not necessarily compassion. True compassion sometimes comes from inaction. A dropout will beat a genius through hard work. Reject common sense to make the impossible possible. Whatever you lose, you’ll find it again. But what you throw away you’ll never get back. If you really want to be strong… Stop caring about what your surrounding thinks of you! Vision is not what your eyes see, but an image that your brain comprehends. Sometimes, people are just mean. Don’t fight mean with mean. Hold your head high. The ticket to the future is always open. Hard work is worthless for those that don’t believe in themselves. A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home. Life comes at a cost. Wouldn’t it be arrogant to die before you’ve repaid that debt? You can die anytime, but living takes true courage. Every journey begins with a single step. We just have to have patience. If you just submit yourself to fate, then that’s the end of it.” It is at the moment of death that humanity has value. People, who can’t throw something important away, can never hope to change anything. Whatever you do, enjoy it to the fullest. That is the secret of life.” Power comes in response to a need, not a desire. You have to create that need. There are no regrets. If one can be proud of one’s life, one should not wish for another chance.” You can’t always hold on to the things that are important. By letting them go we gain something else.” If you don’t like your destiny, don’t accept it. Instead, have the courage to change it the way you want it to be. Don’t beg for things. Do it yourself, or else you won’t get anything. I refuse to let my fear control me anymore.” If you can’t find a reason to fight, then you shouldn’t be fighting.” You should never give up on life, no matter how you feel. No matter how badly you want to give up.” People who can’t throw something important away, can never hope to change anything. We can’t waste time worrying about the what if’s.” Fools who don’t respect the past are likely to repeat it. That’s why I can’t make a change. Everything I do is so… Half-assed.” Sometimes it’s necessary to do unnecessary things. An excellent leader must be passionate because it’s their duty to keep everyone moving forward. Protecting someone means giving them a place to belong. Giving them a place where they can be happy. Thinking you’re no-good and worthless is the worst thing you can do Sometimes I do feel like I’m a failure. Like there’s no hope for me. But even so, I’m not gonna give up. Ever!” If you can’t do something, then don’t. Focus on what you can do.” When you lose sight of your path, listen for the destination in your heart. The moment you think of giving up, think of the reason why you held on so long.” Don’t give up, there’s no shame in falling down! True shame is to not stand up again! No matter how hard or impossible it is, never lose sight of your goal.” Life is not a game of luck. If you wanna win, work hard. The world isn’t perfect. But it’s there for us, doing the best it can….that’s what makes it so damn beautiful. Fear is not evil. It tells you what your weakness is. And once you know your weakness, you can become stronger as well as kinder. To know sorrow is not terrifying. What is terrifying is to know you can’t go back to happiness you could have. Knowing you’re different is only the beginning. If you accept these differences you’ll be able to get past them and grow even closer. Don’t be so quick to throw away your life. No matter how disgraceful or embarrassing it may be, you need to keep struggling to find your way out until the very end. The world’s not perfect, but it’s there for us trying the best it can. That’s what makes it so damn beautiful. We are all like fireworks: we climb, we shine and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even when that time comes, let’s not disappear like a firework and continue to shine.. forever. If nobody cares to accept you and wants you in this world, accept yourself and you will see that you don’t need them and their selfish ideas. When you hit the point of no return, that’s the moment it truly becomes a journey. If you can still turn back, it’s not really a journey. Those who stand at the top determine what’s wrong and what’s right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice! A person grows up when he’s able to overcome hardships. Protection is important, but there are some things that a person must learn on his own. Who decides limits? And based on what? You said you worked hard? Well, maybe you need to work a little harder. Is that really the limit of your strength? Could you of tomorrow beat you today? Instead of giving in, move forward. Mistakes are not shackles that halt one from stepping forward. Rather, they are that which sustain and grow one’s heart. Fear is freedom! Subjugation is liberation! Contradiction is the truth! Those are the facts of this world! And you will all surrender to them, you pigs in human clothing! Hatred and Sorrow are power. They are yours to control. All you have to do is to turn them into strength and use that strength to move forward. It’s not always possible to do what we want to do, but it’s important to believe in something before you actually do it. Life and death are like light and shadow. They’re both always there. But people don’t like thinking about death, so subconsciously, they always look away from it. It’s more important to master the cards you’re holding than to complain about the ones your opponent was dealt.” I am the hope of the universe. I am the answer to all living things that cry out for peace. I am the protector of the innocent. I am the light in the darkness. I am the truth. Ally to good! Nightmare to you! If you’re gonna insist on gambling and then complain when you lose, you had better work on your game.” Moving on doesn’t mean you forget about things. It just means you have to accept what’s happened and continue living. If nobody cares to accept you and wants you in this world, accept yourself and you will see that you don’t need them and their selfish ideas. If you keep on hiding your true feelings, who is going to be happy? If you are sad, you should say it out loud! Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because… No matter how pathetic the reason, it’s enough to start a war. War will never cease to exist… reasons can be thought up after the fact… Human nature pursues strife. Don’t be upset because of what you can’t do. Do what you do best, live as carefree and optimistically as you can, because some people aren’t able to do that. If you begin to regret, you’ll dull your future decisions and let others make your choices for you. All that’s left for you then is to die. Nobody can foretell the outcome. Each decision you make holds meaning only by affecting your next decision. Everything has a beginning and an end. Life is just a cycle of starts and stops. There are ends we don’t desire, but they’re inevitable, we have to face them. It’s what being human is all about. Anything can happen. No one ever thinks it will until it does. What will happen, happens. That’s how the world is. The most important thing is to not let the tragedy defeat you. To believe that you can get through it. You’ll only realize that you truly love someone if they already caused you enormous pain. Your enemies can never hurt you the way your loved ones can. It’s the people close to your heart that can give you the most piercing wound. Love is a double-edged sword, it can heal the wound faster or it can sink the blade even deeper. I want you to be happy. I want you to laugh a lot. I don’t know what exactly I’ll be able to do for you, but I’ll always be by your side. “A lesson without pain is meaningless. That’s because no one can gain without sacrificing something. But by enduring that pain and overcoming it, he shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart.” You need to accept the fact that you’re not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face. I too will obtain everything that I desire. Not because someone asked me to do it, but because I know in my heart that I have something worth fighting for. You can’t win a game by doing nothing. And if someone else wins it for you then you haven’t accomplished anything. Life is the same way. Do not think about other things, there is only one thing you can do. So master that one thing. Do not forget. What you must imagine is always that you, yourself, are the strongest. You do not need outside enemies. For you, the one you have to fight is none other than your own image. Life is like a tube of toothpaste. When you’ve used all the toothpaste down to the last squeeze, that’s when you’ve really lived. Live with all your might, and struggle as long as you have life.” Just like games, no matter how well you have things lined up in your life, there’s always something to keep you on your toes. Do exactly as you like. That is the true meaning of pleasure. Pleasure leads to joy and joy leads to happiness.
